## About Me
-  ðŸ’¼ I'm currently researching/working on building my own AI bot. A bot that I call as MEGAT. It is a combination of simple automation and a small AI model
   that utilize transformer based neural network architecture.
- :atom: Artificial Intelligence intrigued me. I want to crack the blackbox of AI (ChatGPT, LLama) and develop my own and even improve upon it
- ðŸŒ± I'm constantly learning and exploring new technologies. Slowly building my repository, combining process engineering and technology. 
- ðŸ’¡ Solving problems are one of my passion. Doing something straightforward is something that I don't want to do.
- ðŸ“š Always open for collaboration!!

## Projects
Here are some of the projects I've been working on:
### Building my own AI
- [Megat Nano-GPT](https://github.com/maercaestro/nanoGPT-megat): Nano-GPT that I build myself and configured to train data based on my works as malay novelist.
- [Megat Tokenizer](https://github.com/maercaestro/megat-tokenizer): A tokenizer that I build myself based on BPE Algorithm by Open AI.
- [Transformer from Scratch](https://github.com/maercaestro/transformer-scratch): My first attempt to build my first transformer from scratch

### Building my own engineering solutions
- [Megat Peng Robinson](https://github.com/maercaestro/megatpengrobinson): Utilizing Peng Robinson Equation of State and NIST Database API, it's just a simple
  streamlit web app showcasing Peng Robinson Equation of State
- [Megat P&ID Extractor](https://github.com/maercaestro/pidextractor): Simple web app that are able to extract required information from a P&ID.
- [Refutas Library](https://github.com/maercaestro/RefutasLibrary): A python library for calculating viscosity of a mixture by using Refutas Equation.

- âš¡ Fun fact:
I'm not sure if you'd consider this fun, but in addition to being a process engineer and an AI enthusiast, I've also authored and published a science fiction novel.
In it, I delve into the potential risks associated with AIâ€”a topic that might strike you with its irony. You can find my book available for purchase here:
